# Pluto

A simple template engine for the
[plutonium language](https://github.com/shehryar49/plutonium-lang)

## Getting Started

Take a look at `docs/spec.md` for the specification.

## Building Pluto

You will need the following tools for building Pluto:

* git
* dub - installed alongside [DMD](https://dlang.org/download.html)

Run the following to build Pluto:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nafees10/pluto.git
cd pluto
dub build -b=release # ignore -b=release to enable debug messages
```

This will build the executable `pluto` or `pluto.exe` which you can move to
any directory in your `$PATH` like:

```bash
sudo cp pluto /usr/bin # on linux
```

## Using Pluto

Pluto works by taking template files, and generating plutonium code files that
contain a render function.

The render function will take a plutonium dictionary as a parameter and populate
the template with data from the dictionary.

To generate plutonium code from a template file:

```bash
pluto homePage.pluto
```

The above command will generate a file named `homePage.plt` which will contain
the `renderHomePage` function.

To specify output file:

```bash
pluto homePage.pluto template.plt
```

The function name will be `renderHomePage` in either case.

## Example

Create the following `homePage.pluto` file:

```html
<head>
	<title> {title} </title>
</head>
<body>
	<table border="solid">
		<tr> <th> Name </th> </tr>
		<for name names>
			<tr> <td> {name} </td> </tr>
		</for>
	</table>
</body>
```

And run:

```bash
pluto homePage.pluto
```

Then create the following `code.plt` file:

```plutonium
import "homePage.plt"

var map = {"title" : "This page was generated by pluto", "names": ["aa", "bb", "cc"]}
renderHomePage(map)
```

Execute the `code.plt` by running:

```bash
plutonium code.plt
```

It should give the following output:

```
<head>
	<title> This page was generated by pluto </title>
</head>
<body>
	<table border="solid">
		<tr> <th> Name </th> </tr>
		
			<tr> <td> aa </td> </tr>
		
			<tr> <td> bb </td> </tr>
		
			<tr> <td> cc </td> </tr>
		
	</table>
</body>
```
